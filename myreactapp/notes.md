# React.js :
> It is a library of javascript. (A library is a collection of pre-define codes.)
> To create Single page Application we use React.

# Next.js :
> It is a framework (A framework collection of library)

# Features of React.js :
1) Single Page Application
2) Declarative (It Tells -> What to do?)
3) The Data in the webpage changes due to Component Based Architecture( Dividing webpage into different Components is known as CBA. Component are building block of webpage) 
4) Virtual DOM ( Copy of Real DOM)

<!-- Components -->
> Components are building block of WebPages.
> In component the file name will always start with capital letter.
> Reusable Components.

<!-- Components are of 2 types -->

1) Class Based Component :
> In Class Based we use JS Classes.
> Statefull Component
> NO Hooks
> Life Cycle Methods
> It Contains of 'This' Keyword
> Render

2) Function Based Component
> In Function Based we use JS Functions                         .
> Stateless Component
> TO make Function Based Statefull we use - HOOKS
> No Life Cycle Methods
> It does not Contains of 'This' Keyword
> No render

# Web page application are of 2 type:

1) MultiPage Application.
> It Contains Multiple HTML,CSS,JavaScript pages.
> It is slower than Single page Application.
> Reload of the Page
> ex: Amazon.
> Can't use Cache Storage.

2) SinglePage Application
> It contains Single HTML Page. -> Using React JS
> They are more faster than MultiPage Application
> No reload
> ex: Chai DOCS, FindCoder.
> can use Cache Storage.
> Have Cache Storage

<!-- Create react app and vite are the way to install node,react -->

<!--React Folder Structure  -->
# Node Modules Folder :
> Pre-defined codes are present here.

# Public folder:
> Contains all those files which required Globally.

# Src: 
> Source folder , code will be done here.
> Except main.jsx(java Script Xml/js can be fine)
> main.jsx and App.jsx (App.jsx is Component)

# Gitignore

# Single Html file  
> no change need to be done here
> important id=root

# Package.json
> It is the directory of the project.

# Package-lock.json
> Metadata(details of data) of Package.json

# project -> project name --> To run the project npm run dev


* jsx -> Combination of JS and XML

1) New src
2) Create file name main.jsx 
3) Create file name App.jsx -> App.jsx -> Is a Component (and function is the component)
4) Create a component or function ( can be named or arrow function )
* Error will be detected from Console
5) If a function return an XML then it will be called componenet (else it will be normal function)


* Function can be called in 2 ways -> In React JS we use  
* Settings --> Compact folder --> uncheck

# Class Based Component :

* Component is also a component in React
* ctrl+ space for suggestions
* Need to import, if not the error will occur if we try to use the XML tag (not defined)1
