br# React.js :
> It is a library of javascript. (A library is a collection of pre-define codes.)
> To create Single page Application we use React.

# Next.js :
> It is a framework (A framework collection of library)

# Features of React.js :
1) Single Page Application
2) Declarative (It Tells -> What to do?)
3) Component Based Architecture( Dividing webpage into different Components is known as CBA. Component are building block of webpage) 
4) Virtual DOM

<!-- Components -->
> Components are building block of WebPages.

<!-- Components are of 2 types -->

1) Class Based Component :
> In Class Based we use JS Classes.
> Statefull Component
> NO Hooks
> Life Cycle Methods
> It Contains of 'This' Keyword
> Render

2) Function Based Component
> In Function Based we use JS Function.
> Stateless Component
> TO make Function Based Statefull we use - HOOKS
> No Life Cycle Methods
> It does not Contains of 'This' Keyword
> No render

# Web page application are of 2 type:

1) MultiPage Application.
> It Contains Multiple HTML,CSS,JavaScript pages.
> It is slower than Single page Application.
> ex: Amazon.
> Can't use Cache Storage.

2) SinglePage Application
> It contains Single HTML Page. -> Using React JS
> They are more faster than MultiPage Application
> ex: Chai DOCS, FindCoder.
> can use Cache Storage.
> Have Cache Storage

<!-- Create react app and vite are the way to install node,react -->
<!--Structure  -->
# Node Modules Folder :
> Pre-defined code are present here.

# Public folder:
> contains all those files which required Globally.

# Src: 
> Source folder , code will be done here.
> Except main.jsx(java Script Xml/js can be fine)
> Main Code

# Gitignore

# Single Html file  
> no change need to be done here
> important id=root
# Package.json
> It is the directory of the project.

# Package-lock.json
> Metadata of Package.json

# project -> project name -> npm run dev

* note : 
To write tag in XML 
 1) <br></br>
 2) <br/>

# States 
> A container used to store the data in a Component

# Hooks
> In-build Function
> useState is a Hook

# ES7 + React/redux/react-native snippets
-> rafce (React Arrow function component export)

# CBC is statefull 

# Props -> Properties
> To send the data from one function to other function
> To send the data from child to parent
> It is not like inheritence
> To create a prop -> propname ={propvalue} with in the tag


# For Props
# For Props Drilling
* For Nested child 
parent -> Child1 -> Child2 (Props Drilling)
